## Platform
1. DistAlgo Version: 1.1.0b15
2. Python Implementation: CPython
3. Python Version: 3.7.12
4. OS: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
5. Hosts: Google Cloud Platform (VM)

## Instructions

Instructions to build and run the system:  
Step 1: Install the below Pre-requisites  
Step 2: Run the program by below execution command  
Step 3: Check generated log files

### Step 1 : PreRequsites

1. Python (3.7.12)
2. pip
3. PyNacl & cffi
4. DistAlgo

```
pip3 install pynacl
pip3 install pyDistAlgo  
python3.7 -m pip install cffi
```

### Download
```
1. DistAlgo ( http://distalgo.cs.stonybrook.edu/tutorial )
2. pip install pynacl  ( to download Libsodium crypto library which is used for signatures and crypto hashing )
```

### Execution and scripts
Run the program by executing below command:

```
python3.7 -m da main_run_tests.da ./config/config.json
```



### Workload Generation
Various workload as well as test cases can be generated by editing the `diemBFT/config/config.json` file. The json configuration is self-explainatory.


### Bugs and Limitations

1. The system miss-behaves for concurrent transactions by the client
2. The system works for max 2 clients in parallel and starts miss-behaving for further more clients
3. The program does not generate automated reports
4. The last transaction is not commited by all the replias. It waits for another transaction message to initiate another proposal to commit in other replicas.


### Main Files

The `diemBFT` directory is root directory containing all the files for the system.  
The `main_run_tests.da` is the main Runner file which starts the program and runs the tests.
